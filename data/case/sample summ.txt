The case of Esther Sarante is a premises liability personal injury matter handled by Cohan Law Firm, PLLC, arising from injuries she sustained due to dangerous and unsafe conditions on a property owned and managed by the defendants 1601 Bronxdale Property Owner LLC and Meringoff Properties, Inc., whose legal status and corporate details were verified through formal entity searches included in the file. The client’s identity and residence were confirmed through her driver’s license, case screen, retainer documents, and property-related records, including the deed, digital tax map, and property tax bill, which establish ownership, control, and jurisdiction over the premises where the accident occurred. The incident is documented in the binder, matter notes, and photographic evidence, which show the condition of the accident location, surrounding environment, and the injuries sustained by the plaintiff, demonstrating hazardous surfaces, poor maintenance, lack of warning signs, and failure to remedy known defects. Following the incident, the client sought medical treatment for her injuries, and the firm obtained a signed HIPAA authorization allowing access to medical records and billing information, which supports claims for physical pain, emotional suffering, medical expenses, and related damages. An attorney-client relationship was formally established through the OCA Retainer Statement dated February 28, 2022, outlining the contingency fee arrangement and representation terms, and this was supplemented by engagement letters and correspondence. The firm conducted a comprehensive investigation, collecting property records, tax documents, corporate registrations, photographs, and internal notes to establish liability and responsibility of the defendants for maintaining safe premises. A formal claim letter was issued to assert liability and demand compensation, and ongoing correspondence was maintained with insurers, defendants, and medical providers. The case screen and matter notes contain detailed administrative and strategic records, including timelines, communications, case status updates, and follow-up actions. A Summons and Complaint was drafted and prepared for filing in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, naming Esther Sarante as plaintiff and the identified property owner and management company as defendants, alleging negligence, failure to inspect, failure to maintain, failure to repair, and failure to warn of dangerous conditions, asserting that the defendants had actual and constructive notice of the hazardous condition and that their breach of duty directly caused the plaintiff’s injuries. The pleadings seek monetary damages for medical costs, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, incidental expenses, legal costs, and other appropriate relief. The file also contains binder compilations, internal case summaries, client intake information, administrative records, and evidentiary materials demonstrating that the matter has progressed through intake, investigation, medical documentation, liability verification, demand, and litigation preparation stages. Overall, the documentation reflects a fully developed premises liability case supported by verified ownership records, corporate defendant information, medical authorizations, photographic evidence, formal retainer filings, detailed matter notes, and court-ready pleadings, positioning the firm to pursue settlement negotiations or proceed to trial to recover damages on behalf of the injured client.
